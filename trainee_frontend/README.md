# Trainee Frontend

This is the **Frontend** of the **Trainee Project**. It contains a simple HTML page with basic CSS styling to display a "Welcome" message.

---

## Steps to Set Up the Frontend

### 1. Create the Project Folder

1. Create a new folder for your frontend project. Name it `trainee_frontend`.

    - On **Windows**, right-click and select **New Folder**.
    - On **macOS/Linux**, open a terminal and run:
      ```bash
      mkdir trainee_frontend
      cd trainee_frontend
      ```

### 2. Create the `index.html` File

1. Inside the `trainee_frontend` folder, create a new file named **`index.html`**.
2. Add the basic HTML structure that will display the "Welcome" message.
3. The `index.html` file should link to the **`style.css`** file for styling, which will be created in the next step.

### 3. Create the `css` Folder

1. Inside the `trainee_frontend` folder, create a folder named **`css`**. This folder will store your styling files separately from the HTML file.
   
    - Run the following command:
      ```bash
      mkdir css
      ```

### 4. Create the `style.css` File

1. Inside the newly created **`css`** folder, create a new file named **`style.css`**.
2. This **`style.css`** file will contain the styling for the page, such as background color, text alignment, and font styling.

### 5. Folder Structure

After completing the steps above, your project folder structure should look like this:



## How to Test
